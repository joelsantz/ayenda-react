## 🚀 Getting Started Manually
Please clone repo or download .zip, now we got to install dependencies and run the project:

```bash
npm install
# next
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) now we can see the test running.


## 🧐 What About plugins and frameworks?
Based on the technical test and its requirements, I used React as main front-end library, NextJs for the advantages of SSR (Server Side Rendering) together with 
React and NextJs I used Emotion to create easly styled components, Fontawesome and Google Fonts for a couple of details.
- React
- NextJs
- Emotion
- Babel
- Fontawsome, Google Fonts

I didn't see the need to use a css framework so I just used flex-box.

## 😬 Hey the test doesn't look like the guide
I felt a bit creative and wanted to change the style a bit, a simple style with no border-radious or blur box-shadow, (yes, these are nice, really nice) but taking advantage of the API theme, I thought something flat, that looks like comic sheets, I kept with the sense of the test and I didn't change the main features.

## 😎 Conclusions
I felt very good doing the test, it was fun, Marvel API is a really great API to do this kind of thing, I would like to add a couple of unit tests and maybe other filters for searches, for time it was not possible, but really I had a great time!

Thanks for your attention and time, I'm waiting for your feedback!
